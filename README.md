# Task
The purpose is to find any patterns and/or trends regarding at what age women in the US
tend to get married for the first time, separated by the average of each State.
Data was collected between 2006-2010 and again between 2015-2019, my intent
is to see what, if anything, has changed between these two time frames.
As well as identifying any correlation between the average age women get married for
the first time and population density per square mile.
